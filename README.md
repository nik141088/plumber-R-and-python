# plumber-R-and-python

This repository achieves the following tasks:
1) exposes APIs through R plumber. Data Scientists can write their analysis in R and then expose them through this channel.
2) The consumption of APIs is platform agnostic. I provide both R and python implementations. It can be done through web browser and excel as well.
3) The communication is secured through 2-way public key encryption. Client requests server's public key and shares their own key to initiate communication.
